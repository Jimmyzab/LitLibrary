# LitLibrary
LitLibrary is a UI library for roblox. Most likely it works with PC. [UNFINISHED, IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT]

Brought to you by a solo dev(me).

Planning to release it in 2-3 months, because i still need to learn much + school.
If you wanna teach me how to make libraries properly or give advice, dm me in discord --> blblstr
